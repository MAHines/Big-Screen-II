Big Screen II is an iOS app that transmits, and optionally records, live
video from the camera to a second screen connected by AirPlay. The
controls are not mirrored to the second screen.

Big Screen II is part of a digital whiteboard developed in the Hines Lab
in the Dept. of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University.
The whiteboard is sketched below. The lecturer faces the classroom and
writes on a sheet of illuminated glass with a fluorescent pen. The
front-facing camera on the iPad behind the glass captures a video of the
lecturer and his/her drawings and writing. Because the front camera
flips the image horizontally, the lecturer's writing is not reversed.
Unlike a traditional white board, the lecturer cannot obstruct the
writing. A full description of the whiteboard is given in E. S.
Skibinski, W. J. I. DeBenedetti, A. G. Ortoll-Bloch, and M. A. Hines, "A
Blackboard for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century: An Inexpensive Light Board Projection
System for Classroom Use," *J. Chem. Educ.* **92,** 1754 (2015).

Instructions for constructing the digital whiteboard can be [downloaded
here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00155/suppl_file/ed5b00155_si_001.pdf).

A big thanks is due to Kirby Turner of White Peak Software, Inc. who
wrote the original Big Screen and who graciously shared his source code.
Big Screen II is a *de novo* rewrite of Big Screen with added
videorecording capability. All bugs are mine.

Development of the digital whiteboard was supported by the National
Science Foundation under Award CHE-1708025.
