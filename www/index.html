      Big Screen II
    </center></h2>
    <p>Big Screen II transmits, and optionally records, live video from the camera to a second screen connected by AirPlay. The controls are not mirrored to the second screen.</p>
    <p>Use Big Screen II as a document camera to videoconference lectures and office hours from home. <strong><a href="http://hines.chem.cornell.edu/DIY-doc-camera.html">Click for DIY document camera instructions.</a></strong><p>

<p> Big Screen II is part of a digital whiteboard developed in the Hines Lab in the Dept. of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University. The whiteboard is sketched below. The lecturer faces the classroom and writes on a sheet of illuminated glass with a fluorescent pen. The front-facing camera on the iPad behind the glass captures a video of the lecturer and his/her drawings and writing. Because the front camera flips the image horizontally, the lecturer’s writing is not reversed. Unlike a traditional white board, the lecturer cannot obstruct the writing. A full description of the whiteboard is given in E. S. Skibinski, W. J. I. DeBenedetti, A. G. Ortoll-Bloch, and M. A. Hines, “A Blackboard for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century: An Inexpensive Light Board Projection System for Classroom Use,” <em>J. Chem. Educ.</em> <b>92,</b> 1754 (2015).</p>

      <p>A big thanks is due to Kirby Turner of White Peak Software, Inc. who wrote the original Big Screen and who graciously shared his source code. Big Screen II is a <em>de novo</em> rewrite of Big Screen with added videorecording capability. All bugs are mine.</p>
      <p>Development of the digital whiteboard was supported by the National Science Foundation under Award CHE-1708025.</p>
